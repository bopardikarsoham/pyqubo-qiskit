# pyqubo-qiskit
Created a plugin for Qiskit optimization problems. After obtaining the QUBO dictionary from pyqubo, we use this converter to get the n-local Hamiltonian. Qiskit usually allows only a 2-local Hamiltonian. This is a qubit-efficient circuit for encoding a higher number of protein beads on current NISQ Quantum Computers.
